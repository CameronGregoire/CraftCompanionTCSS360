## User Stories
The code we have selected supports the following stories:

1. As a project manager, I can create a new project so that I can keep different projects organized and separate.

2. As a project manager, I can load an existing project so that I can review/edit the information inside of it.

3. As a project manager, I can import and export project folders and user_info files.

## Outstanding Questions and Thoughts from the Team

       +Our UI uses BorderLayout to place New, Load, Export, and Import buttons in the South. I wonder if we can put these buttons a little more practical.

       +We would like to know whether our UI of WelcomeFrame, NewFrame, or LoadFrame works properly on different resolutions. 


       +Our NewFrame class will catch invalid input such as non numerical value and negative value. However, It canâ€™t catch a positive value with more than two floating values such as 2000.1234. We wonder if it's appropriate for us to catch this wrong input. If we had to, we'd like to know how.
